## Evaluating performance of microwave image reconstruction algorithms: extracting tissue types with segmentation using machine learning
### Supplementary Materials
Detailed results for all cases presented in section 3.1 including the clusters after each iteration and the evolution of the PDF of the data over the segmented tumor region and outside the tumor regions.

### List of Figures
1. Figure S1: Model 1 forward model segmentation results
··*Caption: Model 1 forward model segmentation results. (top-left) Region R extracted from forward model; (middle L-to-R) Evolution of clusters at k = 3, 4, 6, and 8; (bottom-left) Evolution of PDF over data within tumor region and outside tumor region where numbers indicate iteration; (bottom-centre) PDF over data within clusters c_2, and (bottom-left) clusters c_3 (blue line) to c_7 (black line). Cluster c_2 corresponds to fatty tissue, c_3-c_4 corresponds to transition tissue, c_5-c_7 fibroglandular tissues, and c_8 corresponds to malignant tissue, which are mapped to segmentation masks leading to segmented image (top-right).
